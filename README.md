## Introduction

The field of finance relies heavily on quantitative analysis and statistical learning to make informed decisions. This repository serves as a toolbox for students in finance who are interested in leveraging the power of statistical learning in their work.

The repository includes a wide range of functions that cover topics such as:

- Data preprocessing and cleaning for financial datasets
- Feature engineering and selection for statistical modeling
- Implementation of various statistical learning algorithms
- Evaluation and validation of models
- Risk management and portfolio optimization techniques
- Simulation and backtesting of trading strategies
- Statistical analysis of financial time series

## Installation

To use the functions in this repository, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/reddymungara/quant-code-collection.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies. It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage your dependencies. You can create a new virtual environment using tools like `conda` or `virtualenv`. Activate the virtual environment and install the dependencies by running:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Once the dependencies are installed, you can import the functions in your Python code using the following statement:
   ```python
   from quant_collect import *
   ```

## Usage

The functions in this repository are organized into different modules based on their functionality. Here are some examples of how you can use them:

### Data Preprocessing and Cleaning

```python
from quant_collect.data_preprocessing import remove_duplicates, normalize_data

# Remove duplicate rows from a financial dataset
cleaned_data = remove_duplicates(data)

# Normalize financial data using a specified normalization technique
normalized_data = normalize_data(data, technique='z-score')
```

### Statistical Learning Algorithms

```python
from quant_collect.statistical_learning import linear_regression, random_forest

# Perform linear regression on financial data
model = linear_regression(data, target_column='returns')

# Train a random forest classifier on financial data
model = random_forest(data, target_column='direction')
```

### Risk Management and Portfolio Optimization

```python
from quant_collect.portfolio import calculate_var, calculate_cvar

# Calculate Value at Risk (VaR) of a portfolio
var = calculate_var(returns, portfolio_weights, confidence_level=0.95)

# Calculate Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) of a portfolio
cvar = calculate_cvar(returns, portfolio_weights, confidence_level=0.95)
```
